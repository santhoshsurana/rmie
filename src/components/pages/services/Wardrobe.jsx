        <p className=" text-base leading-relaxed text-justify text-gray-600 p-4 md:w-4/5" ><span className="font-semibold text-teal-900">Sustainability:</span> Sustainability is becoming increasingly important in the design of commercial spaces. Consider incorporating features such as energy-efficient lighting and heating/cooling systems, as well as materials that are recycled or sustainably sourced. The design of an office or commercial space should be functional, comfortable, and reflective of the business's branding and values. By considering the needs of those who will use the space and incorporating sustainable design elements, you can create a space that is not only visually appealing, but also supports the productivity and well-being of its occupants.</p>
