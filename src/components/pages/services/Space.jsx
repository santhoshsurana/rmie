        <p className=" text-base leading-relaxed text-justify text-gray-600 p-4 md:w-4/5" >Our 2D layouts provide a clear and detailed representation of the floor plan, including the placement of furniture and fixtures. This allows you to visualize the space and make any necessary adjustments before the project begins. Our 3D modeling takes it one step further, allowing you to see the space in a more realistic and immersive way. You can see how the colors and textures work together, and make sure that the design is cohesive and visually pleasing. We also use the latest technology to create interactive 3D walk-throughs, so you can experience the space before it's built.</p>
