                  <p className="mb-9 text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-600 font-normal  " data-content="about-us">Modern style of interior design is characterized by clean lines, minimalism, and a focus on functionality. This style is heavily influenced by the Bauhaus movement, which emphasized the use of industrial materials and a minimal aesthetic.

                    One of the key elements of modern interior design is the use of neutral colors, such as white, gray, and black. These colors create a sense of simplicity and open space, making the room feel larger and more airy. In addition, modern design often incorporates natural materials such as wood, stone, and metal. These materials add a sense of warmth and texture to the space, while still maintaining the clean, minimalist aesthetic.

                    Another important aspect of modern interior design is the use of clean lines and geometric shapes. This can be seen in the use of simple, unadorned furniture, as well as in the use of lines and angles in the architecture of the space. The focus on simplicity and functionality is also reflected in the use of minimal decor, with the emphasis on a few key pieces that make a strong statement.

                    In terms of lighting, modern interior design typically incorporates a mix of natural and artificial light. Large windows and skylights are often used to bring in natural light, while strategically placed task lighting and accent lighting are used to create a sense of depth and drama.

                    Overall, modern interior design is all about creating a space that is clean, functional, and visually striking. By using a minimal color palette, natural materials, and clean lines, modern design creates a space that is both beautiful and practical.

                    However, it's important to note that Modern design is not only about minimalism, there are a lot of sub-types of modern interior design like Mid-Century Modern, Industrial Modern, Scandinavian Modern, and so on, each with their own take on the style.

                    It's up to the designer or homeowner to mix and match the elements that best suit their taste and lifestyle.</p>
